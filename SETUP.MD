## Creating Groups
**When creating groups for /list to work, you MUST do the following.**

- Set the weight of the group
- Set the suffix of the group to a color code (https://minecraft.tools/en/color-code.php)
- Set the prefix of the group
- Set the displayname of the group to the same as the prefix

Once all above is completed, your /list command will now work!

If you have any issues setting this up, or need help setting it up, feel free to dm `herbert__` on Discord!
